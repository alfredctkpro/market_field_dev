Our sense for many months has been <br/>that we had reached the point at which PCs start to transition into a legacy <br/>product just as main-frame computing, cathode ray TVs, print photography, VHS <br/>recorders and DVD players have done over the last 20 years. Based on the <br/>experience of these prior cycles, we suspect that the transition will be <br/>somewhat swifter and further reaching than current consensus estimates.<br/><br/>This is a potent reminder that within the US over the last 4 years, we have not <br/>simply been dealing with a recovery from the disaster of 2008 but have started <br/>an entirely new economic cycle. This cycle would seem to be increasingly driven <br/>by consumer behavior, which has not only recovered quantitatively but has <br/>changed qualitatively to a significant degree (which helps explain the side <br/>dispersion of performance in retail stocks in recent months with clear winners <br/>and losers).<br/><br/>This is particularly true in terms of technology usage, where a genuine <br/>innovation cycle (led by the introduction of Amazon's Kindle and Apple's <br/>iPhone) commenced on the eve of the housing crisis but was largely obscured <br/>from view during the dark days of 2007 and 2008, and the V shaped recovery of <br/>2009. The equity market is of course well aware of this shift and has acted <br/>accordingly. We used a chart showing Apple's "cannibalization" of its <br/>competitors' market caps and we have attached an updated copy in case anyone <br/>missed the original version. Today's IHS release suggests that further <br/>disruption of technology performance can be expected in the months ahead as the <br/>PC industry comes under increasing pressure to hold onto its current position <br/>at the heart of consumer and business technology usage.<br/><br/><br/><br/>IHS: PC SHIPMENTS SET TO FALL IN 2012 FOR FIRST TIME IN 11 YRS<br/>2012-10-10 17:36:59.99 GMT<br/><br/><br/>(The following is a reformatted version of a press release<br/>issued by IHS iSuppli and received via electronic mail. The<br/>release was confirmed by the sender.)<br/><br/>PC Shipments Set to Decline in 2012 for First Time in 11 Years<br/><br/>El Segundo, Calif. (Oct. 10, 2012)--After entering the year with<br/>high hopes, the global PC market has seen its prospects dim,<br/>with worldwide shipments set to decline in 2012 for the first<br/>time in 11 years, according to the IHS iSuppli Compute Platforms<br/>Service at information and analytics provider IHS (NYSE: IHS).<br/><br/>The total PC market in 2012 is expected to contract by 1.2<br/>percent to 348.7 million units, down from 352.8 million in 2011,<br/>as shown in the figure attached. Not since 2001--more than a<br/>decade ago--has the worldwide PC industry suffered such a<br/>decline.<br/><br/>“There was great hope through the first half that 2012 would<br/>prove to be a rebound year for the PC market,” said Craig Stice,<br/>senior principal analyst for computer systems at IHS. “Now three<br/>quarters through the year, the usual boost from the back-to-<br/>school season appears to be a bust, and both AMD and Intel’s<br/>third-quarter outlooks appear to be flat to down. Optimism has<br/>vanished and turned to doubt, and the industry is now training<br/>its sights on 2013 to deliver the hoped-for rebound. All this is<br/>setting the PC market up for its first annual decline since the<br/>dot-com bust year of 2001.”<br/><br/>From hope to disappointment<br/>The year started off with major hope for Intel’s ultrabooks at<br/>the annual Consumer Electronic Show (CES) in Las Vegas. New and<br/>innovative form factors like convertibles, combined with the<br/>first appearance of Windows 8 demos on display, provided a fresh<br/>wave of enthusiasm for the possibility of a revitalized PC<br/>market. Even when first-quarter PC shipments came in, the less-<br/>than-stellar results were thought to be a minor setback.<br/>The high expectations continued midyear during the big PC event<br/>at Computex in Taiwan, as Intel plugged its latest Ivy Bridge<br/>processor. Shipments during the second quarter, however, once<br/>again disappointed.<br/>For now, important questions remain for the PC market and the<br/>rest of the year:<br/><br/>-         How much impact will Windows 8 really have toward<br/>boosting the PC market in the fourth quarter?<br/><br/>-         Will continuing global economic concerns neutralize<br/>whatever hype or interest has been generated by ultrabooks?<br/><br/>-         Will mobile computing gadgets such as tablets and<br/>smartphones win over PCs during the crucial holiday selling<br/>season, taking precious consumer dollars and keeping PC sales at<br/>bay?<br/><br/>There are signs that a strong rebound could still occur in 2013.<br/>While IHS has reduced its forecast for them, the new ultrabooks<br/>and other ultrathin notebook computers remain viable products<br/>with the potential to redraw the PC landscape, and the addition<br/>of Windows 8 to the mix could prove potent and irresistible to<br/>consumers. Whether a newly configured PC space could then stand<br/>up to the powerful smartphone and tablet markets, however,<br/>remains to be seen.<br/><br/>For more information, please contact:<br/><br/>Jonathan Cassell<br/>Senior Manager, Editorial<br/>jonathan.cassell@ihs.com<br/>Direct: + 1 408 654 1714<br/>Mobile: +1 408 921 3754<br/><br/>Or<br/><br/>IHS Media Relations<br/>press@ihs.com<br/>+1 303 305 8021<br/><br/>About IHS (www.ihs.com)<br/>IHS (NYSE: IHS) is the leading source of information and insight<br/>in critical areas that shape today’s business landscape,<br/>including energy and power; design and supply chain; defense,<br/>risk and security; environmental, health and safety (EHS) and<br/>sustainability; country and industry forecasting; and<br/>commodities, pricing and cost.

China and Brazil have had clear <br/>evidence of deterioration in their local economies discussed in the global <br/>media while Russia has its own issues with political and corporate governance <br/>and a close connection to the Eurozone. These factors have served to direct <br/>investment flows to other portions of the EM complex, with India in particular <br/>benefiting from "BRIC" focused investors. India has therefore benefited from a <br/>form of benign neglect, with most investors simply unaware of the massive long <br/>term structural issues (including a budget deficit greater than Italy, a large <br/>and widening trade deficit and persistently high inflation) facing the country <br/>and the degree of cyclical deterioration that has taken place in recent months.<br/><br/>We doubt this situation can be maintained for much longer and either the local <br/>economy will confound our expectations and accelerate out of its recent slump, <br/>or corporate earnings will start to reflect what we believe are significantly <br/>adverse local conditions. <br/><br/>One sign that things are moving towards the latter scenario is the stagnation <br/>of local car and motorcycle sales. Car sales has been expected to grow by up to <br/>10% in 2012/3, a forecast that has now been cut to 1%. The very strong sales of <br/>early 2012 have given way to several months of sub-par sales with both August <br/>and September seeing sales fall below their 2011 levels. September sales were <br/>157.5K, a drop of 5.4% from their 2011 level. This is significantly better than <br/>the state of the local motorcycle market, which still dominates Indian total <br/>vehicle sales by volume. September sales were 906K units, the lowest monthly <br/>sales since January 2011 and a decline of 17.6% from 2011 activity. It <br/>therefore would seem that economic weakness is starting to build at the lower <br/>income levels of the Indian economy, but once established the deteriorating <br/>trend is unlikely to remain focused on one portion of domestic demand. ]]></content></article><article><id>2a3fb9f2-97e0-4a2d-af8b-398470ce577c</id><title><![CDATA[US Consumer Credit Data August 2012]]></title><date>October 8, 2012</date><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/revolvingcredit12100811090052.jpg</thumbnail><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/totalcredit12100811090438.jpg</thumbnail><content><![CDATA[As we mentioned in our note on Economic Surprise indexes, Consumer Credit data <br/>is too volatile on a month by month basis to be used as a "real time" <br/>indicator.

We have used the former since the summer of 2010 to argue <br/>that the cyclicality of data creates the appearance of economic acceleration <br/>and deceleration many times over the course of a singe cycle, with good periods <br/>following bad and vice versa. We therefore noted the turn in this index in <br/>mid-July from its low of -65.30 and of the more reliable 50 day ma in early <br/>August from its low of -54.5. Less than 3 months later the index is over 100 <br/>points higher at 43.50, while the trailing 50 day ma has reached -3.13 and the <br/>experience of the last 2 years suggests that data will continue to surprise to <br/>the upside for the next 2 to 4 months.<br/><br/>The Bloomberg Economic Surprise Index has rather less pedigree, but makes up <br/>for this with greater transparency (terminal users can hit {ECSU &lt;go&gt;} for <br/>details). This index is still in negative territory at -0.12 (it ranges from +1 <br/>to -1) but has started to move back towards neutral having bottomed on July <br/>31st at -0.422. The difference in the timing of the two indexes moving into <br/>positive territory is a reflection of different weightings being given to <br/>different data. Turns in data are always patchy, the Bloomberg survey appears <br/>to use many more data points, which probably has caused it to pay too much <br/>attention to very unreliable data like monthly changes in Durable Goods and <br/>Consumer Credit. However the Bloomberg index still tends to trend just as <br/>clearly as the CESIUSD and can be expected to push into positive territory <br/>later this quarter and peak somewhere between 0.4 and 0.6.<br/><br/>Our assumption is that a steady stream of positive data surprises will be <br/>supportive for the local equity market (which having largely ignored the data <br/>slowdown may have already priced some improvement into its current level) but <br/>quite problematic for longer term treasury yields. 3.00% looks like a key level <br/>for the 30 year treasury to stay below and a break above this level could <br/>signal that we are at the start of a significant unwind of the collapse in <br/>treasury yields that took place earliest this year.]]></content></article><article><id>0dd23080-3490-4db2-bb24-740e30e44082</id><title><![CDATA[BLS Payroll and Unemployment Report September 2012]]></title><date>October 5, 2012</date><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/unemployment12100509125740.jpg</thumbnail><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/nfpprivate12100509125749.jpg</thumbnail><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/householdsurvey12100509125762.jpg</thumbnail><content><![CDATA[There is no doubt as to which statistic will be driving the headlines in the <br/>general and financial media this weekend and that is the sharp drop in the <br/>estimated unemployment rate to 7.8%, its lowest level since the Obama <br/>administration took charge in January 2009 (this is a statement of fact and not <br/>a suggestion that government policy has had much to do with the recent drop).<br/><br/>We will discuss the ramifications of this drop later in this note but first we <br/>will deal with the headline NFP report. This showed Total Payrolls growing by a <br/>modest 114K, almost matching expectations of 115K. On the other hand sizable <br/>upward revisions were made to the August data (up 46K to 142K) and the July <br/>data (up 40K to 181K) which really removes the whole notion of a summer <br/>slowdown in employment trends (justifying our lonely skepticism at the time). <br/>Private Sector Payrolls were a little more disappointing, growing by 104K <br/>compared to 130K estimates and with small negative revisions. We have a hard <br/>time believing the BLS's data but we will have to see some significant pick up <br/>in the survey in the next few months to keep the trailing 12 month ma from <br/>falling below the 150K level from its current level of 154.7K (see chart).<br/><br/>Meanwhile the really shocking data came from the Household Survey where a <br/>massive 873K jobs were estimated to have been added. This is the greatest <br/>increase since January 2003. Of course the Household survey (which is used for <br/>the Unemployment report) is even more erratic than the Establishment Survey <br/>(which drives Non Farm Payroll) and had shown substantial job losses over the <br/>last 2 months totaling -314K. We do note however that the trailing 12 month ma <br/>of the Household Survey has now reached 238.9K suggesting a much more <br/>meaningful pickup in employment is taking place than in the Establishment <br/>Survey.<br/><br/>Rather like the relationship between ADP and NFP, over time the differences <br/>between the Household and Establishment surveys tend to even out and over the <br/>last 30 years the Household Survey has averaged 119K versus 120K for the <br/>Establishment Survey. The greater pace of improvement in the Household Survey <br/>again increases the odds that the Establishment data will eventually follow <br/>suit.<br/><br/>Of more importance is the effect of Household Survey job gains on the estimated <br/>Unemployment rate. The sudden drop to 7.8% has the potential to be a game <br/>changer for the perception of this employment cycle and means that over the <br/>last 12 months Unemployment has fallen by -1.20% the quickest drop since <br/>February 1995. As the attached chart shows Unemployment data tends to trend <br/>powerfully once it starts to move and would seem to have a shot of targeting <br/>7.0% or lower over the next few quarters. This would put it well ahead of the <br/>FOMC's schedule and as we argued in the Weekly Speculator the "open ended" <br/>nature of QE3 should not be interpreted as meaning "never ending". ]]></content></article><article><id>c25c5553-e787-4044-8283-ad063d4d5ee6</id><title><![CDATA[Swiss Reserves September 2012]]></title><date>October 5, 2012</date><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/swissreserves12100508125109.jpg</thumbnail><content><![CDATA[Although the Euro-fix may have served to greatly moderate financial stress in <br/>the sovereign credit market and allowed the EUR to recover a good portion of <br/>its losses against the USD, the SNB is still having to add to its EUR purchases <br/>in order to keep the EUR/CHF cross above 1.20, albeit at a significantly <br/>reduced rate.<br/><br/>September's addition to reserves were 8.5 bln CHF, a 2.2% increase for the <br/>month. This is significantly lower than the massive sums expended from May to <br/>July when an average of almost 57 bln CHF of intervention took place, but 3 <br/>years ago (prior to the massive inflation of reserves) intervention on this <br/>scale would have increased total reserves by over 10% in a single month. At <br/>least the SNB finally has something to show for its troubles, with the EUR/CHF <br/>cross peeling off the 1.20 level and rising to 1.216 on September 14th before <br/>closing the month at 1.208. This may suggest that this prolonged period of <br/>massive intervention is drawing to a close, but this would simply mean that <br/>reserves would now stop growing powerfully and would still leave the SNB with a <br/>the task of mopping up the massive amount of excess liquidity that has been <br/>created in recent months. <br/>]]></content></article><article><id>ea8c1499-a898-42dc-89a4-6339ef6df020</id><title><![CDATA[Challenger Job Cuts and Hires]]></title><date>October 4, 2012</date><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/challengerjobs12100408564265.jpg</thumbnail><content><![CDATA[Even by the low standards of employment data, the Challenger Job Cuts and Hire <br/>data is an erratic series that should only be used to supply some background <br/>color to an overall picture of that may be taking place. Nevertheless the very <br/>surprising September data is still worth considering in the run up to the <br/>monthly "Non-Farm Nonsense" of tomorrow morning.<br/><br/>The Monthly Job Cuts survey showed 33816 cuts announced, slightly above <br/>August's 32,239, but down a hefty -70.80% from the level of September 2011. <br/>Indeed this is the lowest September reading since the series starts in 1999 <br/>(the data is not seasonally adjusted so this is significant). This supports our <br/>notion that the emotional stability of those currently employed is <br/>substantially higher than would normally be the case with an 8.2% unemployment <br/>rate. It may still be hard to find employment but it is getting less easy to <br/>lose it.<br/><br/>On the hiring side of the ledger, the Challenger data shows a very surprising <br/>surge to 425K job announcements, more than double the prior high for monthly <br/>hires. This was dominated by retail hires of 413K, which are likely to be short <br/>term seasonal jobs for the holiday season. Although this cannot be taken as <br/>evidence that employment conditions have substantially improved, an upside blip <br/>of this magnitude should not be wholly ignored, and at the very least suggests <br/>that the US retail sector is starting to gear up for a somewhat busier last 3 <br/>months of the year than had been anticipated. <br/>]]></content></article><article><id>68642e9c-d1d3-4991-89a0-7160444de7e4</id><title><![CDATA[Brazilian Auto Sales September 2012]]></title><date>October 4, 2012</date><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/brazilautosales12100413304779.jpg</thumbnail><content><![CDATA[The experience of the "Cash for Clunkers" policy in the US (and also that of <br/>the Housing Tax credit) is that fiscal handouts can shift the timing of <br/>consumption demand but has little effect on total demand measured over a longer <br/>period of time with substantial post-policy hangovers wiping out the surge of <br/>demand while the government's generosity is in effect.<br/><br/>Something similar would seem to be taking place in Brazil where a reduction in <br/>local excise duty saw car sales surge in the summer months, reaching an all <br/>time high of 420K vehicles in August.

As we explained at the time, all the disappointment a month ago really <br/>missed the point about the data. We have a collection of vaguely accurate <br/>(certainly no better than that) employment reports, which over a period of <br/>months tend to correlate with each other reasonably well. Therefore a steady <br/>improvement in ADP and Initial Claims data (which is what has taken place in <br/>recent months) meaningfully increases the odds that BLS data will follow suit <br/>sooner or later.<br/><br/>Regarding the September report, ADP estimates that 162K jobs were added, rather <br/>more than the 140K estimate. August's very strong report was trimmed from 201K <br/>to 189K and the trailing 12 month ma rose to 183.4K, the highest level since <br/>April 2005. It is the steady rise of this metric that is the strongest clue <br/>that employment conditions have improved in recent months.<br/><br/>Attention now shifts to the BLS report. We consider it something of a scandal <br/>that the FOMC has tied monetary policy and local interest rate expectations so <br/>closely to this data without describing its innate inaccuracy (on the other <br/>hand the nation's politicians have treated the unemployment rate as gospel for <br/>decades). Last week saw a preliminary revision to the 12 months of data ending <br/>in March 2012 of 386K for Total Payrolls (+32K) and 453K for Private Sector <br/>Payroll gains (+37.7K per month), a story which generated scarcely a ripple in <br/>the financial media. Again we would argue that a large upward revision to past <br/>data makes it more likely that the BLS's "guesstimation" process will generate <br/>some positive surprises in the coming months, although we'll make no promises <br/>about Friday's data. <br/>]]></content></article><article><id>c38e1dd8-eb51-41c0-bee9-0bcdb430c18a</id><title><![CDATA[Ireland Live Register of Unemployment September 2012]]></title><date>October 3, 2012</date><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/itrlandunemployment12100308161361.jpg</thumbnail><content><![CDATA[Ireland's Live Register of Unemployed Persons fell by-0.4K in September; a small <br/>decline but nonetheless the 3rd consecutive drop and the 7th out of the last 12 <br/>readings.

The very sharp drop in risk premia attached to Ireland <br/>can only help this process along (we have used the 5 year CDS as a proxy) since <br/>it both reduces local financing costs and helps rebuild local confidence.

One of these is a seasonal tendency to track higher <br/>between Easter and the mid summer and then track lower post-Labor Day (the more <br/>influential BLS monthly data has suffered from the same flaw since 2009). For <br/>instance after a poor spring and summer, Initial Claims fell by almost 9% from <br/>September 16th 2011's reading of 414K to 377K at the end of the year.<br/><br/>This makes the next few weeks of Initial Claims quite important and this week's <br/>report was certainly a step in the right direction.

This morning's release of Conference Board <br/>Consumer Confidence came in at 70.30, well above expectations of 63.1 and last <br/>month's reading of 61.3. However, a surge of confidence following a strong <br/>month in the equity market should not come as a great surprise, and this <br/>month's reading still keeps confidence trapped in its post-crisis range between <br/>40.90 (October 2011) and 72.0 (February 2011).<br/><br/>What is interesting is the degree to which the recovery in consumer confidence <br/>has lagged that of the SPX index. The latter is closing in on its all time high <br/>(and has surpassed it on a total return basis) while confidence is still 20 <br/>points below its average reading of 91.58 since the series commenced in 1970. <br/>Moreover, consumer discretionary stocks have actually led the 42 month bull <br/>market, comfortably outperforming the overall index.<br/><br/>This disconnect is highly unusual and helps explain the great reluctance of US <br/>retail investors to participate in the current equity market. US equity mutual <br/>funds have lost $550 bln of assets since the start of 2007, of which roughly <br/>300 bln were redeemed during the current bull market. Our view is that <br/>confidence is likely to start to narrow the gap to the equity market in the <br/>months ahead (perhaps it will take a new all time high in the SPX to allow this <br/>to happen), and that a breakout in consumer confidence would probably coincide <br/>with a more pro-equity shift by the local retail population. This willingness <br/>of US consumers to invest may coincide with some short term difficulties (as it <br/>did in Q2 2010), but over the longer term we would welcome a more balanced view <br/>of the local equity market by US consumers. - confidencespx.gif]]></content></article><article><id>fceba7cb-860b-4132-90bb-69525db325aa</id><title><![CDATA[Italy Consumer Confidence &amp; FTSE MIB Index]]></title><date>September 25, 2012</date><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/italyconfidenceftse12092508470501.jpg</thumbnail><content><![CDATA[Yesterday we wrote about Brazilian consumer confidence and its relationship to <br/>the local equity market and this morning we will perform the same exercise on <br/>Italy.

In part this <br/>reflects the fact that although economic growth has stalled, local unemployment <br/>continues to be muted at 5.3%. On the other hand actual job creation has been <br/>sub-par in recent months (see last week's note), but this has not yet chipped <br/>away at confidence.<br/><br/>The recent bounce in the local equity market will also have helped (consumer <br/>confidence surveys are very closely related to investor sentiment), as will the <br/>general belief that the interest cuts and fiscal measures enacted earlier this <br/>year will help Brazil's economy avoid a process of sharp adjustment.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this is typical of the state of affairs in the middle of a long <br/>drawn out bear market.

July's loan activity data was released this morning <br/>and shows the number of new loans for houses running at 24,291, almost exactly <br/>the same as June's level of 24,321. This is still -5167 loans less than the <br/>level of a year ago but only 200 loans less than the average activity over the <br/>last 6 months. This compares with annual draw-downs of over 20K in 2010 & 2011 <br/>and over 40K in 2008 & 2009.<br/><br/>Current activity is a mere 18% of peak loan activity of 129K recorded in <br/>September 2005, which corresponds to our definition of a post bubble crash <br/>whereby a haircut of roughly 80% can take place.

More <br/>accurately periods of very low volatility tend to be followed by periods of <br/>more chaotic trading, which themselves tend to be caused by falling prices. <br/>Interestingly the last time treasury implied volatility measured by the MOVE <br/>index (see chart) was below the current level was May 2007, which was the<br/>early portion of the sub-prime crisis and the start of a treasury rally that took <br/>yields down from over 5% across the curve to the ultra-low treasury curve of <br/>today.<br/><br/>At the current time it is far more likely that any period of heightened <br/>volatility would be caused by a rise rather than a fall in bond yields. We <br/>would not say that volatility measures have yet reached the point at which a <br/>clear danger signal is being generated but they have certainly reached an <br/>abnormally low level. This combined with the massive flows that have been <br/>allocated to fixed income and the equally massive issuance by corporations <br/>(currently a record $1,074 bln YTD) and the government does seem to create a <br/>potentially unstable combination that is out of kilter with the recent collapse <br/>in the price of protection.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bond Volatility Approaches Record Low as Fed Drains Convexity<br/>2012-09-20 13:15:41.758 GMT<br/><br/><br/>By Liz Capo McCormick<br/>Sept. 20 (Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve’s decision to<br/>hold borrowing costs steady into 2015 and buy mortgage debt each<br/>month is reducing bond market volatility and demand for options<br/>that hedge against changes in interest rates.<br/>Mortgage bond holders often use swaptions, or options on<br/>interest-rate swaps, to guard against swings in rates, which can<br/>trigger changes in levels of expected mortgage refinancing and<br/>the debt’s value. Losses on mortgage debt are greater than on<br/>similar maturity and coupon Treasuries when interest rates rise<br/>due to so-called negative convexity, which causes the bonds<br/>duration, a measure of price sensitivity to interest-rate<br/>changes, to simultaneously increase.<br/>Bond market volatility is already approaching the lowest<br/>levels since just before the global financial crisis. The fall<br/>suggests the $40 billion monthly mortgage purchases and rate<br/>guidance announced last week by the Fed may prove to be<br/>successful in pushing investors into higher-returning assets, a<br/>goal of the central bank as it seeks to spur economic growth and<br/>lower unemployment.<br/>“The combination of the strengthened forward rate guidance<br/>from the Fed and a new round of quantitative easing is a<br/>negative for volatility,” said Ruslan Bikbov, a fixed-income<br/>strategist in New York at Bank of America Corp. “The perception<br/>of a longer Fed-on-hold and the fact that the central bank is<br/>taking negative convexity out of the mortgage-backed securities<br/>market will cause volatility to decline.”<br/><br/>Volatility Gauge<br/><br/>Normalized volatility on three-month options for 10-year<br/>U.S. interest-rate swaps, known as 3m10y swaptions, fell to as<br/>low as 73.9 basis points yesterday, from 83.6 basis points on<br/>Sept. 13, the day before the Federal Open Market Committee<br/>announced new steps to ease monetary policy. The rate fell in<br/>July to the lowest since June 2007. The gauge of volatility on<br/>swaptions signals expectations for the pace of fluctuations in<br/>swap rates.<br/>In a swap, two parties agree to exchange fixed for variable-<br/>rate payments over a set period. Swap rates are higher than<br/>Treasury yields because the floating rate payments on a swap are<br/>based on interest rates that contain credit risk, such as the<br/>London interbank offered rate, or Libor.<br/>The FOMC also said in its statement last week that “a<br/>highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain<br/>appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery<br/>strengthens,” heightening speculation that debt purchase and<br/>rates will prove prolonged.<br/>Policy makers have kept their target rate for overnight<br/>loans between banks in a range of zero to 0.25 percentage point<br/>since December 2008.

The index reached a high for the<br/>year of 95.40 basis points on June 15. The record low of 51.20<br/>basis points was in May 2007.<br/>Another factor likely to depress volatility is that some of<br/>the sellers of the mortgage securities to the Fed may choose to<br/>replace the optionality lost in their portfolios in the process,<br/>according to Neela Gollapudi, a New York-based strategist at<br/>Citigroup Inc.<br/>“The owners of un-hedged MBS positions who give the<br/>securities over to the Fed will have to replace it somewhere<br/>else,” Gollapudi said in an interview.  “If they want to do<br/>that in the options market, they would sell swaptions. The<br/>likely impact on swaption volatility will not be negligible.”<br/><br/>Biggest Buyer<br/><br/>Normalized volatility on 3y10y swaptions is likely to fall<br/>five to seven basis points over the next three months, Gollapudi<br/>said.

It has bought $305 billion of securities<br/>under the reinvestment program, which it announced with the<br/>first round of its so-called Operation Twist program for<br/>Treasuries, where it swaps short- for long-term debt on its<br/>portfolio.<br/>Including the existing program in which the Fed is<br/>reinvesting proceeds from its past purchase of housing debt into<br/>the market, the central bank will be buying about $65 billion to<br/>$70 billion a month, according to Bank of America.<br/>“The Fed will be buying mortgages, and they’re not going<br/>to hedge out any of the convexity,” Nancy Davis, director of<br/>derivatives in New York at AllianceBernstein LP, said in a<br/>telephone interview. “That is one reason why rate volatility<br/>has been selling off aggressively.

As the attached <br/>charts show Japanese exports to the US reached ¥886 bln in August, a rise of <br/>10.3% over the prior year. Exports to China were slightly higher at ¥966 bln, <br/>but this represents a fall of -9.9% over the same period. Should this pace be <br/>sustained the US will once more become Japan's primary export market sometime <br/>in 2013. This sustained slippage of Japanese exports to China suggests that <br/>domestic demand remains under significant pressure.<br/><br/>One additional factor that may start to depress Japanese trade with China is <br/>the increasing tension over territorial claims. This morning's news included a <br/>story describing the hoisting of a banner urging the death of Japanese citizens <br/>over a local Audi dealership (others have merely offered discounts for those <br/>wishing to trade in Japanese cars), which gives a sense of the bad blood that <br/>is building over this matter (see link):<br/><a href="http://www.japanprobe.com/2012/09/18/audi-dealership-in-china-we-must-exterminate-the-japanese/">http://www.japanprobe.com/2012/09/18/audi-dealership-in-china-we-must-exterminat<br/>e-the-japanese/</a><br/><br/>At least relations with Europe remain on a much more businesslike footing, but <br/>here a combination of a sharply lower €/¥ cross rate (-10.5% for the year <br/>ending August 31st) and a depression of local demand saw exports drop by <br/>-22.9%. Even allowing for currency effects this is a steep drawdown, and we <br/>doubt that the recent Euro-fix will result in a sharp improvement in the <br/>immediate future. - japanchinausexports.gif - japaneuexports.gif]]></content></article><article><id>e0a2d56e-0615-4f09-aa7f-68abca5e1c28</id><title><![CDATA[US Existing Home Sales August 2012]]></title><date>September 19, 2012</date><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/M-ECSLHAFS_Index12091911080712.jpg</thumbnail><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/D-EHSLSL_Index12091911080722.jpg</thumbnail><content><![CDATA[US Existing Home Sales provided yet another positive data point for the US <br/>housing market, with total sales rising to 4.82mm, well above consensus estimates <br/>of 4.56mm and last month's pace of 4.47 mm. This is the best level of sales <br/>since the tax credit boosted month of November 2009 and setting aside that period <br/>puts sales back to where they were in August 2007. Single Family Home sales <br/>were 4.30mm, which ignoring tax-credits, was the best reading since July 2007.<br/><br/>Interestingly, single family inventory levels rose to  2.210mm units, but this <br/>was caused by a surge in new listings to 555K. This should be taken as a sign <br/>that the up-tick in the level of activity is encouraging sellers to seek to <br/>take advantage and we see this as a positive development. Inventory measured <br/>by months of sales actually fell to 6.2 months, and should fall below the <br/>psychologically important half-year mark in the coming months.<br/><br/>Condo inventory remains much tighter, falling by 18% to 259K this month. This <br/>is already at 6 months of sales and condo inventory looks likely to get quite <br/>tight this winter when sellers traditionally pull listing from the market.<br/><br/>Going forwards, we would like to emphasize the degree to which seasonal <br/>adjustments will start to favor the data. This may be particularly true given <br/>the important role that financial buyers have been playing in housing activity. <br/>These are likely to be much less sensitive to completing a sale in the winter <br/>months than a traditional home-buyer, who may not want to move homes during <br/>inclement weather. A smaller than normal seasonal dip in the data could <br/>therefore generate some surprisingly strong headline sales during the dead of <br/>winter that may give the impression of an even greater acceleration of activity <br/>than would actually be occurring. <br/> ]]></content></article><article><id>fad006fc-b5f0-434b-8866-199e57b5837e</id><title><![CDATA[SHASHR Index Relative to MXEF Index]]></title><date>September 19, 2012</date><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/shashrandmxef12091910020139.jpg</thumbnail><content><![CDATA[Over the last two weeks we have seen the ECB, FRB and BOJ announce important <br/>new monetary policy and while we can quibble over the wisdom of each move (we <br/>welcome the former and are less positive about the other two), it was hardly a <br/>surprise to see international equity prices lifted strongly over this period.<br/><br/>The one clear exception to this rising tide remains the local Chinese equity <br/>market, which enjoyed a strong one day bounce of 3.7% on September 7th <br/>(following the announcement of fiscal stimulus) and then proceeded to grind <br/>away this gain over the next couple of weeks. As can be seen on the attached <br/>chart, this has produced a relative breakdown of the Chinese market versus the <br/>overall MSCI Emerging Market Index (MXEF Index), with the ratio falling back to <br/>its lowest level since May 2006. In absolute terms, the index remains about 2% <br/>above its 2012 low, but looks likely to challenge this level soon enough. The <br/>failure of this index to hitch a ride on the surge in international equity <br/>prices is yet another warning sign that problems in the local economy run <br/>deeper than is generally believed. - shashrandmxef.gif]]></content></article><article><id>e4c74658-c881-40a3-ae76-a2b5e0cf76b2</id><title><![CDATA[US Housing Starts, Permits &amp; NAHB Survey]]></title><date>September 19, 2012</date><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/D-NHSPSTOT_Index12091909035144.jpg</thumbnail><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/M-NHSPA1_Index12091909035155.jpg</thumbnail><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/nahbsept1212091909035166.jpg</thumbnail><content><![CDATA[Yesterday saw the publication of the strongest NAHB Sentiment index since June <br/>2006 (see chart) with breakout data provided by the overall index (40), Present <br/>Sales (42) and Future Sales (51) while Traffic remained in a rising trend (31). <br/>This morning's housing start and building permit data suggests that after a <br/>much better spring and summer selling season, homebuilders are finally starting <br/>to ramp up new construction activity.<br/><br/>Overall housing starts were estimated at 750K in August, just below consensus <br/>expectations of 767K, while July's data was revised slightly lower to 733K. <br/>However, the shortfall took place in the volatile multi-family data and single <br/>family starts reached 535K, which (ignoring the 2010 stimulus) is the best data <br/>since October 2008 and 113K (26%) above the level of August 2011. Overall <br/>building permits were estimated at 803K, just beating consensus of 796K and <br/>roughly unchanged since July's 811K print. Single family permits (our favorite <br/>metric out of this series) reached 512K and finally broke through the trailing <br/>60 month ma, which we have been using as an indicator of recovery.<br/><br/>Of course none of this will come as a surprise to anybody (other than the BLS, <br/>which estimates that -48K construction jobs were lost over the last 6 months). <br/>The S&P 1500 Homebuilder Index {S15HOME index} has risen 77% since the start <br/>of the year and 121% over the last 52 weeks. This week's data has therefore <br/>probably been adequately discounted by this surge in prices, but we still <br/>believe that the length and power of this housing cycle will come as a surprise <br/>in the months ahead. - D-NHSPSTOT_Index.gif - M-NHSPA1_Index.gif - <br/>nahbsept12.gif]]></content></article><article><id>cee46971-1eae-4e05-939e-8f3342b27db5</id><title><![CDATA[BOJ Increases Asset Purchases]]></title><date>September 19, 2012</date><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/japanandusmonetarybase12099092101.jpg</thumbnail><content><![CDATA[The Bank of Japan announced this morning an unexpected increase in its asset <br/>purchase facility of ¥10 trln ($126 bln) from ¥45 to ¥55 trln. To put this in <br/>perspective the entire Japanese monetary base is approximately ¥121 trln (about <br/>$1.55 trln)<br/><br/>It would appear that the decision of the FRB to introduce QE3 created an <br/>intolerable risk that a further increase in the value of the JPY would take <br/>place in the absence of a counter move by the BOJ to increase the supply of <br/>JPY. As can be seen on the attached chart since late 2010 the BOJ has been <br/>somewhat more proactive than is generally recognized. Although the initial <br/>response to the crisis was minimal the response to the March 2011 earthquake <br/>was considerable and roughly matched that of QE2 which was in operation at the <br/>same time.<br/><br/>In fact the really tragic policy mistake was to rapidly drain liquidity in <br/>early 2006. It is often forgotten that Japan was the first large modern economy <br/>to confront "zero bound interest rate policy" via quantative easing, increasing <br/>the local monetary base from approximately ¥60 trln to ¥114 trln between 2001 <br/>and 2006. The sudden reversal of this policy in 2006 undid all the progress <br/>(which took place mostly in the valuation of local equity prices), and while <br/>Japan could be said to have had a "good crisis" in 2008, this was largely <br/>because it had experienced no boom in the prior decade to unwind.<br/><br/>At least the BOJ appears to have learned something from this episode, and would <br/>appear to be determined not to be left behind in the race to reflate. Whether <br/>this is enough to make Japan an attractive destination for investment capital <br/>is another matter, and we would wait to see evidence that the BOJ's largesse is <br/>starting to stimulate credit driven activity in the coming months. - <br/>japanandusmonetarybase.gif

With <br/>very limited empirical data available the 8 month period of QE2 is the best <br/>guide to follow, but it should be recognized that not only is FOMC policy <br/>different this time around but so is the fundamental back-drop of economies and <br/>the price levels and investor allocations within asset markets. Therefore <br/>simply expecting QE3 and QE2 to have similar effects would seem to be an overly <br/>simplistic view.<br/><br/>One area that will be of key interest is the response of US treasury rates. <br/>Having collapsed in the run-up to QE2 these moved sharply higher following its <br/>actual announcement. The greatest rally was seen in the mid portion of the <br/>curve around 5 years, which was precisely the portion of the curve being <br/>targeted by the FRB. This perverse response was largely attributable to the <br/>fact that US economic data was much better than expected from November 2010 to <br/>April 2011 (the Citigroup Economic Surprise Index hit a record high of 97.50 on <br/>March 4th 2011, up from zero in late October 2010). This caused the 2 to 5 year <br/>spread (green on chart) to widen substantially during QE2, and for the 1 to 2 <br/>year spread (blue) to widen through March 2011.<br/><br/>Therefore this time around the response of the US treasury market should also <br/>be determined by economic data going forwards. The attached chart of the <br/>CESIUSD shows that the odds are in favor of a reprise, it would appear that <br/>data cycle bottomed in August and that the swing in seasonal adjustments will <br/>allow a string of positive surprises to unfold as fall turns to winter.<br/><br/>However, this time around in addition to the fact that the FRB is purchasing <br/>MBS and not Treasuries, we have the added use of "extended language" as a policy <br/>tool. With the FOMC indicating that mid-2015 is the earliest yields will rise, <br/>the 5 year portion of the curve is much more rooted to the front end than it <br/>was 2 years ago. This time it is likely to be the longer term portion of the <br/>curve that takes the brunt of the damage. As can be seen, the run up to QE3 and <br/>its first day of existence have seen a substantial widening of the 5 to 10 year <br/>spread (purple) and a modest rise in the 10 to 30 year spread (black). We would <br/>not be surprised to see substantial further widening going forwards and there <br/>is potential for the 5/10 year spread to challenge the 2011 high of 150 bp in <br/>the weeks ahead.<br/><br/>We will break from publishing for the upcoming new year holiday and by the time <br/>we return on Wednesday there should be a better sense of how the overall <br/>response to QE3 has played out in the marketplace. - ustreasuryyieldcurve.gif - <br/>cesiusd.gif]]></content></article><article><id>b0b0cca1-84db-4fd2-b860-155d1716f658</id><title><![CDATA[US Advanced Retail Sales August 2012]]></title><date>September 14, 2012</date><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/usretailsales12091409082836.jpg</thumbnail><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/spretailindex12091409082853.jpg</thumbnail><content><![CDATA[It is a good job that the FRB's mandate covers employment and not retail sales <br/>or the QE3 party would never have got on the road. Readers may recall that it <br/>is only 2 months ago that commentators were bemoaning the 2nd quarter official <br/>retail data which showed three consecutive months of shrinking sales (circle on <br/>chart) for the first time since 2008.<br/><br/>Absent in this analysis was the understanding that this is seasonally adjusted <br/>data and that the poor 2nd quarter data followed a blow-out Q1. There was also <br/>no confirmation of poor sales from the bulk of actual retail earnings reported <br/>by public retail companies, making it almost certain that the Q2 slowdown in <br/>sales was a statistical myth (and that the Q1 surge was equally misleading). <br/>Indeed it has only taken 2 months to repair the Q2 draw-down and August's <br/>robust rise of 0.9% (just above consensus) takes the data up to a new all time <br/>high of $406.75 bln. This represents an annual growth rate of 4.67% over the <br/>last 12 months, which is roughly in line with private sector data over this <br/>period.<br/><br/>Interestingly the equity market proved a much better guide than official data <br/>over the summer. The S&P 500 retail index (RELX) only suffered a modest decline <br/>in the summer swoon and powered up to a new all time high this week. The <br/>consumer discretionary sector has been at the heart of this bull market, a fact <br/>that has not been widely recognized at least until now. We would expect the <br/>latter to change going forwards. - usretailsales.gif - spretailindex.gif]]></content></article><article><id>073f98f8-ee2a-49dc-a2d9-d58c2ebe7af4</id><title><![CDATA[FOMC Statement September 13th 2012]]></title><date>September 13, 2012</date><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/frbbalancesheet12091313121267.jpg</thumbnail><content><![CDATA[See link for text: <br/><a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120913a.htm">http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120913a.htm</a><br/><br/>Commenting on Chairman Bernanke's Jackson Hole speech, we reminded readers that <br/>it always pays to take the Chairman at his word. Having outlined a firm belief <br/>in the efficacy of "unorthodox monetary policy" in improving the economic <br/>situation in the US (undoubtedly true in 2008/9, less so thereafter) and <br/>highlighting the concern regarding US employment data, the release of a poor <br/>BLS August Non-Farm Payroll report last Friday made a further round of asset <br/>purchases significantly more likely to occur.<br/><br/>Today's FOMC statement confirmed our thoughts, while the lack of a dramatic <br/>market response in the immediate aftermath shows that these were widely shared. <br/>The FOMC has decided to immediately start purchasing $40 bln per month of <br/>agency MBS, while keeping Operation Twist in place. This means the FRB will <br/>growing its balance sheet for the first time since QE2 expired in July 2011 <br/>(see chart of historic FRB balance sheet) and bringing the holdings of MBS <br/>securities somewhat closer to treasury holdings going forwards. In addition<br/>the FOMC extended its guidance for exceptionally low rates to mid-2015. <br/>Interestingly, the Fed Funds market for 2015 futures had already discounted this <br/>move and rates actually ticked slightly higher following the statement.<br/><br/>We note that an unusually large proportion of the language was changed from the <br/>prior statement, perhaps indicating the degree of soul-searching that lay <br/>behind the move. The FOMC expressed a concern not so much that things were bad <br/>today, but that "without further policy accommodation, economic growth might <br/>not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market <br/>conditions. Furthermore, strains in global financial markets continue to pose <br/>significant downside risks to the economic outlook".<br/><br/>This defensive language perhaps shows the FOMC is mindful of the chorus of <br/>criticism from some (including ourselves) that a further round of QE was <br/>unwarranted and potentially harmful in the longer term. Looking forwards the <br/>FOMC made it clear that labor market data will be the main determinant of <br/>future asset purchases:<br/><br/>"If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the <br/>Committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities, <br/>undertake additional asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as <br/>appropriate until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability."<br/><br/>We cannot remember a time that labor statistics were deemed to be so central to <br/>FOMC policy, and this statement will only serve to encourage the already <br/>unhealthy obsession with erratic BLS data (what we have termed "Non-farm <br/>Nonsense") going forwards.<br/><br/>Putting those arguments to one side the question now is what happens next. MBS <br/>spreads to treasuries were already tight, and can be expected to remain so. We <br/>noted unusual strength in the homebuilding sector in yesterday's session and it <br/>would seem that this has become a beneficiary of the new policy as have <br/>regional banks.<br/><br/>Meanwhile the underlying treasury market received no new support from the FOMC, <br/>and reflecting this 10 and 30 year yields have tracked somewhat higher in <br/>recent sessions. The 30 year yield is currently challenging key resistance at <br/>3.00%, while the 10 year note yield continues to be capped by its 200 day ma at <br/>1.80%. It will be interesting to see if either yield can break out in the <br/>coming sessions.<br/><br/>Gold had largely anticipated QE3 in recent sessions, moving strongly higher <br/>since late August, but the metal managed to add a further $28 this session to <br/>reach its highest level since February at $1,759. It remains to be seen if <br/>today's move is enough to spark another round of inflows into the precious <br/>metals arena. - frbbalancesheet.gif]]></content></article><article><id>ccdcc5a7-5060-4aee-bd92-babc10d339b9</id><title><![CDATA[Russia Raises Rates]]></title><date>September 13, 2012</date><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/russiarefinancerate12091311080410.jpg</thumbnail><content><![CDATA[In an unexpected move this morning, Russia's central bank chose to raise the <br/>local refinance rate by 25 bp to 8.25%.

The idea being that lower utility <br/>prices will stimulate consumer spending and/or reduce inflation. The response <br/>of the market has been to trim 15-20% of the market cap of the companies at the <br/>center of this new policy.<br/><br/>We see this as an unwelcome reminder that "government stimulus" often does not <br/>follow the same aims as those investing in financial instruments. This is <br/>particularly true in those portions of the world that have never truly left <br/>behind the populist ideologies that had dominated all legislative activity <br/>prior to the last couple of "decades of enlightenment". In Brazil's case the <br/>banking system in particular should be concerned that it would be next on the <br/>list, since the massive margins on consumer loans and growing default rates <br/>would seem to make a tempting target at some point in the future.<br/><br/>Of course this sort of action is not limited to Brazil, a host of emerging <br/>markets have a rich and tragic history of government intervention in local <br/>industry. Our sense is that the "populist pendulum" has started to swing back <br/>from the very benign policies towards a more intrusive and destructive role for <br/>government and that this risk is largely unseen by global investors. - <br/>brazilutilityindex.gif]]></content></article><article><id>5f5d3036-814f-489f-9ba8-7c8feaa8e8b4</id><title><![CDATA[India Industrial Production and Foreign Equity Investment]]></title><date>September 12, 2012</date><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/indianindustrialproduction12091212051143.jpg</thumbnail><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/indiainvestment12091212051155.jpg</thumbnail><content><![CDATA[India's Industrial Production data for July once again disappointed, with YoY <br/>growth estimated at 0.1% compared to expectations of 0.5%. This takes the <br/>trailing 12 month ma of the growth rate down 1% meaning that the industrial <br/>economy has effectively stalled over the prior year.<br/><br/>Ironically this was treated as good news by the local equity market, since it <br/>is assumed that lower industrial activity will heap pressure on the RBI to cut <br/>interest rates further. This allowed the local SENSEX index to push up to the <br/>18,000 level for the first time since March. This sort of contrary market <br/>action is actually fairly normal during the early stages of down cycle when <br/>investors cling to the comforting notion of a "soft landing". The concept that <br/>collapsing production may cause a sharp deterioration in corporate earnings <br/>does not factor into this thinking.<br/><br/>One other factor that we believe has aided the Indian market in recent months <br/>is the fact that it is "not China". It would seem that to the extent investors <br/>have started to limit their exposure to Chinese equities they have looked for <br/>regional alternatives for their investments, or in dedicated BRIC funds to <br/>favor the R&I rather than the B&C. This can be seen in the official data <br/>tracking foreign inflows into Indian equities (see chart). These have now <br/>reached $12.65 bln, the second highest reading for early September, despite the <br/>steady stream of disappointing data and poor quality of local earnings seen so <br/>far this year. - indianindustrialproduction.gif - indiainvestment.gif]]></content></article><article><id>b56a36e0-2a12-4661-a068-b6d1925aaf4b</id><title><![CDATA[Duke University/CFO Magazine China Survey]]></title><date>September 12, 2012</date><content><![CDATA[The receding of Europe from the market's attention opens up more space <br/>(literally in the case of the media) for the consideration of the state of the <br/>Chinese economy.

German participation is still subject to a cap of €190 bln, and this limit <br/>can only be raised by legislative approval (which by implication would still be <br/>constitutionally permissible).<br/><br/>This decision brings our concept of a "Euro-fix" substantially closer to <br/>reality, which means transforming an acute financial crisis in to a chronic, <br/>long term fiscal issue. This still implies a great number of correct decisions <br/>need to be made, but it also means that the 18 month period in which global <br/>markets have been transfixed by the minutiae of the Euro-credit markets is <br/>probably drawing to a close (although we would still expect to see a number of <br/>brief flare-ups in the months ahead).<br/><br/>This is largely reflected in the change in stress indicators in recent weeks. <br/>The overall Bloomberg Eurozone Financial Conditions index {BFCIEU Index} which <br/>this morning has risen to -0.186 (see chart), its best reading since April <br/>2010, right at the start of the Euro-crisis. The trailing 50 day ma is -1.22, <br/>but this should move sharply higher as the older data drops out of the measure. <br/>Euro-CDS spreads have also continued to rally with Italy, Ireland and Spain now <br/>pushing on towards the 300 bp level and Portugal threatening to fall below 500 <br/>bp. We would use 200 bp as the upper end of normal, which means there is still <br/>some way to go in this messy and painful unwind for those who crowded into the <br/>Euro-crisis trade earlier this year. - eurocrisiscds.gif - bfcieuindex.gif]]></content></article><article><id>67aa41c1-4de2-4a9f-b766-a71f20f0869e</id><title><![CDATA[China Budget Data August 2012]]></title><date>September 11, 2012</date><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/chinarevenueandexpenditure12091109024338.jpg</thumbnail><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/chinagovrevenuecumulative12091109024348.jpg</thumbnail><content><![CDATA[China's budgetary data gets little attention in the financial media but it <br/>strikes us that this is a mistake given the widespread belief that the local <br/>and state government is likely to be required to undergo substantial stimulus <br/>measures going forwards.<br/><br/>As can be seen on the attached charts although China's current fiscal position <br/>is reasonably healthy it has started to deteriorate in recent months as revenue <br/>growth has lagged well behind the growth of expenditure. Indeed only 4 out of <br/>the last 12 months have seen government surpluses recorded and the cumulative <br/>deficit over this period is approximately 1 trln CNY ($160 bln). This is hardly <br/>alarming by US or European standards but it is perhaps a less healthy starting <br/>position than most observers would consider.<br/><br/>August's data showed a deficit of -115.7 bln CNY, primarily caused by a surge <br/>in total expenditure (red) to 902 bln CNY, a rise of 11.6% over the prior <br/>period while total revenue (black) was 786 bln, up only 4.2% over the same <br/>period. This pace of revenue growth lags the YTD cumulative pace of over 10% <br/>suggesting either that the trend towards lower tax revenue growth that has been <br/>place in recent months continued to be in effect. The concern for China is that <br/>tax revenue could start to become quite sluggish going forwards while <br/>government spending continues to become more extended, with a substantially <br/>larger budget deficit being run over the course of this slowdown than is <br/>currently anticipated.

Broad money measured by M2 <br/>remains rather more abundant, growing at 13.50% YoY but we believe that it is <br/>M1 that is likely to correlate with actual economic activity and this continues <br/>to grow far slower than the pace of most economic activity reported by China. <br/>In other words 6 months into the monetary easing cycle monetary conditions <br/>remain very tight and the PBOC seems to be in no hurry to address this <br/>situation. - chinamonetarydata.gif]]></content></article><article><id>8d2d2f0e-a690-4304-940c-2819f1f22ce9</id><title><![CDATA[Mexico Industrial Production]]></title><date>September 11, 2012</date><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/mexicoip12091109344593.jpg</thumbnail><content><![CDATA[Sometimes "no news" can be treated as news and it is therefore worth noting <br/>that Mexico's Industrial Production has remained robust through July 2012, in <br/>contrast to most other major emerging market economies.

August trade data <br/>showed total Exports growing by 2.7% YoY, while Imports shrank by -2.6%. Given <br/>the volatility of monthly trade data we try not to make too much of any <br/>individual reading but the point to grasp with Chinese trade is that there has <br/>been a sharp deceleration of both imports and exports over the last 18 months <br/>and we do not believe that there is any simple stimulus measure that can turn <br/>this around, particularly on the export side where China is facing weaker <br/>markets and diminished competitiveness.<br/><br/>Further support for the accuracy of trade data came out last week with the <br/>publication of Port Freight data (see chart) which showed Annual growth of 2.9% <br/>in July (August data is yet to be released), roughly in line with trade data. <br/>Finally the publication of rail volume data this morning (available to Bloomberg users <br/>at {NSN MA45Q01A1I4H &lt;go&gt;}) should act as a warning to those pinning hopes of <br/>recent stimulus measures seeking to pour money into China's railways. Although <br/>Passenger Volume grew by 6%, Cargo Volume shrank by -9.2% (we assume that <br/>coal and iron ore account for a good portion of this slippage).

The ECB's plan of intervention covers most of the <br/>salient points we were looking for and the market reaction suggests that it is <br/>being taken far more seriously than the majority of policies introduced over <br/>the prior 18 months of this crisis.<br/><br/>To a large extent this is because the scale of the problem has been steadily <br/>whittled away over the prior 12 months and we would remind readers that there <br/>have been three key stages to the crafting of a solution:<br/><br/>1. The silent increase in the size of the ECB balance sheet that started in <br/>August 2011 under President Trichet, which helped buy time for more meaningful <br/>action by his successor.<br/><br/>2. The reduction of local interest rates and introduction of the LTRO under <br/>President Draghi. The latter has been a much more powerful strategy than most <br/>people realize and led to an overall stabilization of Euro-zone funding markets <br/>and the limiting of problem markets to specific and small number of sovereign <br/>credits.<br/><br/>3. This week's announcement of planned intervention in both primary and <br/>secondary markets for dislocated sovereign credit markets.<br/><br/>All of the above has left the "Euro-break up" trade looking extremely <br/>ill-thought out. This has been belatedly recognized by those crowding into the <br/>Euro-CDS market and recent weeks have seen a steady decline in local CDS rates. <br/>In recent days this has developed into a rout with very sharp declines in the 4 <br/>rates we have concentrated on. We had set 400 as a breakthrough target for <br/>Spain, Italy and Ireland and all three are now trading well below that level. <br/>Even Portugal has now seen its CDS rate decline to 533 bp. The speed of decline <br/>suggests that those exposed to this trade (which includes a large number of <br/>macro themed hedge funds) are now under significant pressure to liquidate their <br/>positions.<br/><br/>Given the opacity of this marketplace it is not possible to know the size of <br/>positions being liquidated or have a sense of the damage being wrought, but for <br/>those with a concentrated bet on the break-up of the Euro, the last few weeks <br/>have been extremely painful, with significant losses being accrued at a time <br/>when risk assets have posted decent gains. Whether this translated into just <br/>another month of poor performance for a number of funds or genuine duress is <br/>unclear at the current time, but the popularity of this trade and illiquidity of <br/>the underlying market does make its unwind fraught with difficulty. - <br/>eurocrisiscds.gif]]></content></article><article><id>7787c837-8b3f-4f54-9878-172ae4c9f62b</id><title><![CDATA[Non Farm Payroll Data August 2012]]></title><date>September 7, 2012</date><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/nfpprivatesectoraug201212090708595342.jpg</thumbnail><content><![CDATA[Over the past week the majority of US Payroll data has suggested that overall <br/>employment conditions have either stabilized or improved. Unfortunately, the one <br/>piece of data that dominates discussion, policy and investing is the BLS <br/>Non-Farm Payroll report and this produced a poor set of data for August.<br/><br/>Total Payrolls were estimated to have risen by 96K (130K consensus) and Private <br/>Sector Payrolls by 103K (142K consensus), while July's numbers were revised <br/>lower by -22K and -10K respectively. The headline Unemployment Rate fell to <br/>8.1% from 8.3%, largely as a result of assumptions regarding the reduction of <br/>the size of the workforce.<br/><br/>Our own metric for following Payroll data is the 12 month ma of Private Sector <br/>payroll changes (see chart). This managed to rise slightly to 164.50K, since <br/>the very weak data from August 2011 fell out of the calculation. Readers may <br/>recall that a year ago the BLS estimated exactly zero jobs were added to <br/>payrolls, causing President Obama to immediately demand an emergency stimulus <br/>package of over $400 bln be passed (we are surprised no-one has thought to use <br/>these embarrassing sound clips in the run up to the election). This data was <br/>later revised up to 52K and was followed by a series of much stronger BLS data <br/>over the next 6 months, caused in part (we believe) by a swing in seasonal <br/>adjustment factors.<br/><br/>Our view remains that given the inherent volatility and inaccuracy of all US <br/>employment data series they must be considered in a holistic manner and over a <br/>reasonable time period. Followed in this manner the picture suggests that US <br/>employment conditions are slowly but steadily improving and this has not been <br/>changed by today's report.<br/><br/>We do understand, however, that most do not choose to follow our approach, and <br/>that today's report will harden the view of those who believe that greater <br/>monetary stimulus is required. The odds of the upcoming FOMC meeting ushering <br/>additional "unorthodox" policy moves has risen as a result of this report, even <br/>if the need or desirability of further FOMC action has not. - <br/>nfpprivatesectoraug2012.gif]]></content></article><article><id>8911b408-5a71-4597-90d6-784bba84ddbe</id><title><![CDATA[(BN) Draghi’s Statement on ECB Outright Monetary Transactions]]></title><date>September 6, 2012</date><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/erocds12090610011926.jpg</thumbnail><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/bfcieuindex12090610011937.jpg</thumbnail><content><![CDATA[As expected the ECB announced its new proposed policy for stabilizing Euro-zone <br/>sovereign markets.

These will be known as<br/>Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) and will be conducted<br/>within the following framework:<br/><br/>Conditionality<br/>A necessary condition for Outright Monetary Transactions is<br/>strict and effective conditionality attached to an appropriate<br/>European Financial Stability Facility/European Stability<br/>Mechanism (EFSF/ESM) programme. Such programmes can take the<br/>form of a full EFSF/ESM macroeconomic adjustment programme or a<br/>precautionary programme (Enhanced Conditions Credit Line),<br/>provided that they include the possibility of EFSF/ESM primary<br/>market purchases. The involvement of the IMF shall also be<br/>sought for the design of the country-specific conditionality and<br/>the monitoring of such a programme.<br/><br/>The Governing Council will consider Outright Monetary<br/>Transactions to the extent that they are warranted from a<br/>monetary policy perspective as long as programme conditionality<br/>is fully respected, and terminate them once their objectives are<br/>achieved or when there is non-compliance with the macroeconomic<br/>adjustment or precautionary programme.<br/><br/>Following a thorough assessment, the Governing Council will<br/>decide on the start, continuation and suspension of Outright<br/>Monetary Transactions in full discretion and acting in<br/>accordance with its monetary policy mandate.<br/><br/>Coverage<br/>Outright Monetary Transactions will be considered for future<br/>cases of EFSF/ESM macroeconomic adjustment programmes or<br/>precautionary programmes as specified above. They may also be<br/>considered for Member States currently under a macroeconomic<br/>adjustment programme when they will be regaining bond market<br/>access.<br/><br/>Transactions will be focused on the shorter part of the yield<br/>curve, and in particular on sovereign bonds with a maturity of<br/>between one and three years.<br/><br/>No ex ante quantitative limits are set on the size of Outright<br/>Monetary Transactions.<br/><br/>Creditor treatment<br/>The Eurosystem intends to clarify in the legal act concerning<br/>Outright Monetary Transactions that it accepts the same (pari<br/>passu) treatment as private or other creditors with respect to<br/>bonds issued by euro area countries and purchased by the<br/>Eurosystem through Outright Monetary Transactions, in accordance<br/>with the terms of such bonds.<br/><br/>Sterilisation<br/>The liquidity created through Outright Monetary Transactions<br/>will be fully sterilised.<br/><br/>Transparency<br/>Aggregate Outright Monetary Transaction holdings and their<br/>market values will be published on a weekly basis.

It is therefore <br/>interesting to note that the August release showed 32239 job cuts, the lowest <br/>reading since June 2000. Indeed 4 out of the last 6 readings since March 2012 <br/>have been below 40K, which normally coincides with a healthy employment market. <br/>Although the trailing 12 month ma remains just below 50K, the very high <br/>September 2011 print (116K) will fall out of the calculation next month, <br/>allowing this trend indicator to fall sharply.<br/><br/>This in itself does not guarantee that new jobs are being created at anything <br/>like a normal pace (although we suspect that more jobs are being created than <br/>the BLS is measuring) and so unemployment remains on a slow downward path from <br/>its elevated level. However, the dearth of job cuts does mean that the security <br/>of those currently employed is significantly higher than it has been for most <br/>of the last decade. This security is starting to be reflected in greater <br/>consumer activity in general retail sales, car and housing purchases. - <br/>challengeraugust12.gif]]></content></article><article><id>e4493813-5150-458a-8dfa-0004e3851c5d</id><title><![CDATA[ISM Manufacturing Survey August 2012]]></title><date>September 4, 2012</date><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/ismjuly201212090414284369.jpg</thumbnail><content><![CDATA[The August ISM Manufacturing survey continued to suggest a sluggish period for <br/>Manufacturing sector with the overall index coming in at 49.6. Although this is <br/>below the magic "50 level" it is not so by a significant amount and the fact <br/>that this is the lowest reading since July 2009 is only true because the index <br/>is 0.1 below the level of June 2012.<br/><br/>Mid-cycle dips below 50 are not actually that uncommon and were experienced in <br/>1985 (low reading of 47.1 in May) 1995-6 (low point of 45.5 January 1996) and <br/>1998 (low reading of 46.8 in December). On each occasion Manufacturing managed <br/>to pick up steam again and continue to expand for several quarters. On the <br/>other hand dips below 45 have led the general economy into recession and so the <br/>decline in the ISM index has generated some concern in recent months. At <br/>present the bulk of evidence suggests we are experiencing a mid-cycle slowdown <br/>rather than a recessionary swoon, but we would need to wait for future <br/>confirmation in the more important fall period.<br/><br/>In terms of this month's report, the worst data was provided by New Orders (red), <br/>which continue to slip to 47.1 and Production (blue), which fell to 47.2.

This caused <br/>the YoY change in the NSA data to improve from -5.6% to -2.9% (see chart), <br/>again just beating expectations of a -3.3% decline.<br/><br/>As welcome as any positive news will be in Brazil, this modest beat is not <br/>statistically meaningful. The trend for IP remains firmly negative and this is <br/>despite a tax reduction for vehicle purchases, which has boosted local car sales <br/>significantly in recent months. With August originally meant to see the <br/>expiration of tax cuts, a surge in local car purchases has taken place which <br/>should feed through to industrial production later this summer (August sales <br/>were up 28% YoY according to Fenebrave data, which should be confirmed tomorrow <br/>by vehicle manufacturers).<br/><br/>However, the experience of similar moves in other countries is that fiscal <br/>boosts to consumption succeed in the short term by bringing forwards sales, <br/>leading to a nasty hangover once they expire (in Brazil's case the expiration <br/>has been postponed, again mirroring the failed US fiscal boosts for housing and <br/>car sales implemented in 2009 and 2010). Meanwhile last week's credit data <br/>showed private sector banks on hold (total credit outstanding rose by only 1 <br/>bln BRL) and personal sector delinquency nudging back up to 7.9%. This strikes <br/>us as the most important data series to watch in Brazil at the current time, <br/>with the consensus view looking for a second half improvement in the data that <br/>we believe is very unlikely to take place. - brazilip.gif - brazildefault.gif]]></content></article><article><id>9769e560-f279-43bf-88a8-dd5794578055</id><title><![CDATA[August US Car Sales]]></title><date>September 4, 2012</date><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/newcarsalesaugsust201212090415545085.jpg</thumbnail><content><![CDATA[At its heart the current cycle has been dominated by a much more robust <br/>recovery by the US retail consumer than most observers either felt was possible <br/>3 years ago or even recognize today. Although today's Manufacturing data may <br/>have been a little disappointing August car sales made up for some of this by <br/>posting a significantly better level of sales than had been anticipated. Total <br/>SAAR sales were 14.46 mm, above expectations of 14.20 and the best level of <br/>sales since the "cash for clunkers" junket of August 2009. Excluding that dose <br/>of fiscal steroids sales were the best since April 2008.<br/><br/>As the attached chart shows this takes sales roughly 2mm units above their <br/>level of August 2011, a pace of improvement that is echoed by the strong <br/>uptrend of the trailing 12 month ma which has now reached 13.88 mm units. At <br/>the current pace of improvement car sales will reach the 16 mm level by the end <br/>of spring 2013, which would represent a "normalizing" of car sales around <br/>pre-crisis levels. With both the credit sensitive sectors of housing and new <br/>car sales exhibiting unexpected pockets of strength over the summer months it <br/>is increasingly hard to take on board the concept of a US domestic economy in <br/>need of a further dose of radical monetary policy.<br/><br/>Of course the obsession of the FOMC with the level of employment (something <br/>that cries out for much better tools of measurement that the awful and <br/>antiquated statistics provided by the BLS, a topic that is sadly absent in <br/>virtually all statements from the FRB) means that car and housing sales alone <br/>will not determine policy, but they should at least be pause for thought in the <br/>upcoming September meeting. - newcarsalesaugsust2012.gif]]></content></article><article><id>f170bcf1-7bfd-4148-8be4-cab46df6bd51</id><title><![CDATA[Chairman Bernanke Speech at Jackson Hole]]></title><date>August 31, 2012</date><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/jacksonholestories12083110493695.jpg</thumbnail><content><![CDATA[See link for text:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20120831a.htm">http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20120831a.htm</a><br/><br/>Prior to 2010 the annual get-together of central bankers at Jackson Hole was <br/>viewed as an interesting occasion for economists to consider the theoretical <br/>issues behind central banking practice. At most it would elicit some <br/>controversy regarding future policy but it was not generally viewed as a key <br/>event on the macro calendar (see attached chart of media mentions of Jackson <br/>Hole 2000 to 2012 - note this chart does not show this week's story count which <br/>is on track to beat 2011). Chairman Bernanke's decision in 2010 to take the <br/>opportunity to usher in QE2 changed all that, but this choice was heavily <br/>influenced by a nasty dislocation in financial markets that threatened to undo <br/>the progress of the initial "Credit Easing" policies of 2008/9.<br/><br/>The state of the world in August 2012 looks very different, with the SPX close <br/>to a 4 year high, long term treasuries close to record lows and corporate bonds <br/>attracting rapacious demand from global investors.<br/><br/>The problem for the FRB is now strictly economic, with unemployment high and <br/>growth sluggish and although this remains a vital goal for the FRB, it is not <br/>one that requires emergency action. Consequently Chairman Bernanke chose to <br/>return Jackson Hole to its "academic roots" delivering a speech that spoke in <br/>detail about past policy and its effects but offered little guidance as to <br/>future policy.<br/><br/>In doing so he took pains to outline the great progress that the policies <br/>enacted since late 2008 have wrought. However, he stopped just short of taking <br/>our advice to "declare victory and head home" since he clearly left the door <br/>open to future accommodation, which no doubt will be debated within the FOMC <br/>rather than preempted in today's speech (as is appropriate). The market's <br/>obsession (or more accurately the obsession of its commentators)  with the <br/>possibility of QE3 will now move on the the September FOMC meeting.<br/><br/>Although the speech may have disappointed those looking for specific pointers <br/>on policy it did contain some nuggets of interesting observations. Over the <br/>last decade we have always found Bernanke's public comments to be accurate <br/>pointers to his internal beliefs (unlike those of his predecessor) and <br/>therefore it is worth considering the following short passages:<br/><br/>"Estimates of the effects of non-traditional policies on economic activity and <br/>inflation are uncertain, and the use of non-traditional policies involves costs<br/>beyond those generally associated with more-standard policies. Consequently, <br/>the bar for the use of non-traditional policies is higher than for traditional <br/>policies. In addition, in the present context, non traditional policies share <br/>the limitations of monetary policy more generally: Monetary policy cannot <br/>achieve by itself what a broader and more balanced set of economic policies<br/>might achieve; in particular, it cannot neutralize the fiscal and financial <br/>risks that the country faces. It certainly cannot fine-tune economic outcomes."<br/><br/>The above shows that Chairman Bernanke recognizes the limits of monetary <br/>policy. While he can be expected to keep politically sensitive comments on <br/>fiscal policy to a minimum prior to the election this stance may change in its <br/>immediate aftermath.<br/><br/>"In particular, the FOMC will be able to put upward pressure on short-term <br/>interest rates by raising the interest rate it pays banks for reserves they <br/>hold at the Fed. Upward pressure on rates can also be achieved by using <br/>reserve-draining tools or by selling securities from the Federal Reserve's <br/>portfolio, thus reversing the effects achieved by LSAPs. The FOMC has spent<br/>considerable effort planning and testing our exit strategy and will act <br/>decisively to execute it at the appropriate time."<br/><br/>Over the longer term this may prove to be the most important passage in the <br/>entire speech. Clearly there is no chance of the FRB changing policy direction <br/>in the short to medium term, but the above language suggests that whenever <br/>policy starts to be tightened the FRB will be keen to flex its muscles. Just as <br/>unorthodox policy easing is a matter of "learning by doing" the tightening <br/>process will be a somewhat chaotic.<br/><br/><br/>"Some recent policy proposals in Europe have been quite constructive, in my <br/>view, and I urge our European colleagues to press ahead with policy initiatives <br/>to resolve the crisis."<br/><br/>A timely boost for Mario Draghi, who will be addressing the colloquium <br/>tomorrow. Chairman Bernanke chose to place the FRB firmly behind the ECB <br/>President's attempts to craft a "Euro-fix" in the coming weeks. - <br/>jacksonholestories.gif]]></content></article><article><id>34d564fc-ca61-42f2-8e6a-db5d95134f54</id><title><![CDATA[Brazil Tax Revenue July 2012]]></title><date>August 27, 2012</date><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/braziltax12082711484897.jpg</thumbnail><content><![CDATA[Brazil tax collections for July is the latest piece of data to suggest that <br/>Brazil's economy continues to falter.

As we <br/>have suggested before, the grinding decline of the local Chinese equity market <br/>is perhaps the most reliable evidence that local liquidity remains heavily <br/>constrained and there is increasing evidence that the modest deceleration in <br/>official economic statistics has translated into a substantial reduction of <br/>corporate profitability. Having finally breached 2200 the danger is that the <br/>local equity market will move sharply lower with the round number of 2000 an <br/>obvious target.<br/><br/>Since China effectively operates separate capital markets for internal and <br/>external capital (barring a limited amount of QFII exemptions), the decline in <br/>the local "A" share market has caused much less disruption to the overall EM <br/>equity complex than would have been the case in a more open market. Performance <br/>of the offshore "H" shares has been poor in recent months, but even so the HSCEI <br/>index is currently at 9674, compared to its March 2009 low of 6403. This means <br/>that the full emotional impact of the Chinese local market's collapse has not <br/>been transmitted to international investors.<br/><br/>To a large extent the decline of China's equity market is a result of the <br/>reluctance of the PBOC to dramatically ease monetary policy. Unlike ourselves, <br/>most observers expected several rounds of reductions in reserve requirements <br/>and interest rates by the end of summer and this fed the optimistic assumption <br/>that China faced a "Soft Landing" (the unicorn of economic analysis).<br/><br/>As can be seen on the attached chart, news stories referencing both China & Soft <br/>Landing peaked in February and March when the first batch of weak data was <br/>released. The refusal of the PBOC to ease policy has caused a sudden absence of <br/>this term in the media (the week ending August 17th only saw 1 instance, <br/>compared to 155 in early February). In our experience, once commentators stop <br/>using "Soft Landing" they start to utilize rather less hopeful terminology to <br/>describe an economy. We continue to believe that China represents a much <br/>greater danger to global sentiment than either Europe or the US at the current <br/>time, particularly for the emerging market and commodity complexes. - <br/>chinasoftlanding.gif - shashrmxef.gif]]></content></article><article><id>6c56ef97-951b-4441-8b8a-3df34db0f8bf</id><title><![CDATA[US New Home Sales July 2012]]></title><date>August 23, 2012</date><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/D-NHSLTOT_Index12082310315017.jpg</thumbnail><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/D-HSMNTOT_Index12082310315033.jpg</thumbnail><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/completedinventory12082310315046.jpg</thumbnail><content><![CDATA[Given the high quality of recent reports from public homebuilders, it is <br/>unsurprising that the official Census Bureau estimate for New Home Sales is <br/>finally showing persistent improvement in the data. July sales were estimated <br/>at 372K, above expectations of 365K. June's sales were revised 9K higher to <br/>359K but May's sales were revised -10K lower to 372K making revisions a <br/>non-factor. Overall, this pushes new home sales a little closer to the declining <br/>60 month ma, which we have been using as a guide to the recovery in activity.<br/><br/>What is more encouraging than the headline data, is the fact strong reports have <br/>taken place in the key spring and summer seasons. As the NSA sales chart shows <br/>July saw 34K estimated sales, hardly falling form June's level. If the data was <br/>to show a diminished seasonality going forwards, then the headline data could be <br/>expected to get significantly stronger (although overall we would still rather <br/>use actual sales reported by public builders as a guide to the strength of the <br/>market).<br/><br/>One other important point is worth making in today's data. Although overall <br/>inventory remained roughly flat at 142K (4.6 months of sales), the inventory of <br/>COMPLETED units continues to collapse, falling another 4K in July to 38K. This <br/>continues to suggest that builders have allowed the recovery of sales to <br/>outpace the level of construction, which is unsurprising given that most did <br/>not expect to see the robust sales of recent months. This in turn suggests that <br/>the full benefit of the recovery in new home sales has not yet been felt in <br/>broader economic data, but should start to become more apparent in the months <br/>ahead. - D-NHSLTOT_Index.gif - D-HSMNTOT_Index.gif - completedinventory.gif]]></content></article><article><id>7550eb65-d1b0-4676-87c9-b3f5b959c860</id><title><![CDATA[US Initial Claims Data]]></title><date>August 23, 2012</date><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/initialclaims12082309534756.jpg</thumbnail><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/initialclaimsseasonal12082309534765.jpg</thumbnail><content><![CDATA[US initial claims data showed estimated claims at 372K, above expectations of <br/>365K and last week's reading of 368K (revised 2K higher). This takes the 4 week <br/>ma of claims back up to 368K, which is still somewhat below the more elevated <br/>seasons seen in May and June. As can be seen on the attached charts, initial <br/>claims are roughly 9% below their level of a year ago in line with the pace of <br/>improvement seen over the last 18 months.<br/><br/>Although we would not call this pace of improvement exciting, it is persistent <br/>and the most likely path for claims is to fall below the key 350K level at some <br/>point towards the end of 2012. In part this is likely to be caused by a <br/>substantial swing in the effect of seasonal adjustment after Labor Day. We have <br/>attached a seasonal chart of initial claims post 2009 to demonstrate this. As <br/>can be seen claims have shown a strong tendency to decline from September 15th <br/>onwards and we would expect to see this pattern repeated in 2012. Of course the <br/>seasonal chart also demonstrates that constant YoY improvement in the data has <br/>been visible since the summer of 2009, underscoring that we have been in a <br/>steady period of diminished lay-offs over this period of time.<br/><br/>Of course non-farm payroll data and the related unemployment report have <br/>followed a much more erratic path over the last 3 years with Q2 2012 being a <br/>particularly poor period for the payroll data. The latter dominated discussion <br/>at the recent FOMC meeting, which took place before the better than expected <br/>July payroll report (a fact noted by St Louis Fed President Bullard this <br/>morning) and it is probably the August payroll report which will sway the FOMC <br/>towards or against a further round of QE. Nevertheless it is worth considering <br/>the fact that initial claims show a much steadier rate of improvement  and <br/>although less firings does not in itself guarantee more hirings, we do suspect <br/>that recent payroll reports have understated the improvement in the employment <br/>environment. - initialclaims.gif - initialclaimsseasonal.gif]]></content></article><article><id>28806a45-c419-4ff2-b820-bc4fef130de1</id><title><![CDATA[MBA Refinance Index]]></title><date>August 22, 2012</date><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/D-MBAVREFI_Index12082210212905.jpg</thumbnail><content><![CDATA[It is starting to look as if the Refi-boom of 2012 is drawing to a close.

In recent months, financial investment <br/>demand for housing as a rental yield play has become increasingly dominant in <br/>the existing home market and as a result, the pace of sales is now governed as <br/>much by the speed of the foreclosure and title transfer process as true changes <br/>in demand.<br/><br/>This would suggest that total sales will remain around the 4.5mm level for the <br/>next few months, with single family homes representing around 4mm of this <br/>number. We may see some improvement in the data as fall turns to winter since <br/>financial investors are much less likely to be deterred by a worsening of <br/>weather conditions than a traditional buyer of a home, and thus seasonal <br/>adjustments may show a surge in activity later in the year that really reflects <br/>a steadier balance of demand than normal between summer and winter months (and <br/>thus a higher total level of sales over a 12 month period).<br/><br/>Overall, this strikes us as a healthy state of affairs. Housing sales are <br/>currently around the level of the late 1990's, prices have stabilized at very <br/>affordable levels and inventory continues to be absorbed although they remain <br/>at a historically high level of 2.1mm for single family homes (with a <br/>substantial amount remaining in "shadow" inventories).<br/><br/>In the condo market, things have progressed a little further and the inventory <br/>level has fallen back to the point at which the entire post 2005 build-up has <br/>been absorbed. Total condo inventories for July were 303K, a drop of 37% from <br/>July 2012. The trailing 12 month ma for inventories is 313K, the lowest level <br/>since July 2005. As a result we should start to see reports of tightness in a <br/>number of regional condo markets in the months ahead, with rising prices and <br/>new construction being even more obvious in multi-family sales projects than <br/>single family homes. - D-EHSLSL_Index.gif - M-ECSLHAFS_Index.gif -  ]]></content></article><article><id>7f1afe24-66c5-4eca-896c-aeac1b505f30</id><title><![CDATA[Technology Market Caps 2007 - 2012]]></title><date>August 22, 2012</date><thumbnail>http://ogru.com/blog/content/binary/sm/aaplndx12082209251992.jpg</thumbnail><content><![CDATA[Yesterday's session saw the NDX index mark a new 12 year intra-day high of <br/>2802.91 before reversing to close slightly lower at 2772.20. Powering this gain <br/>was AAPL's surge to a new all time high of $674.88, forcing its market cap up <br/>to a remarkable $615 bln at the closing price of $656.02.<br/><br/>Almost by definition the anointment of a new global leader in market cap is a <br/>sign that investor enthusiasm for a stock and associated thematic has reached a <br/>mature phase. It does not however mean that an imminent correction is required <br/>or preclude further gains (although it does of course require ever greater <br/>amounts of capital). What is interesting about AAPL's surge over the last 5 <br/>years is that it has come at the expense of a number of large technology <br/>companies that have been caught wrong-footed by the companies wave of <br/>innovative products and services. This is quite different to the emergence of <br/>the large technology bellwethers in the late 1990's that did so as part of a <br/>group (the same could be said of energy stocks or emerging market stocks in the <br/>mid 2000's).<br/><br/>The attached chart compares the market caps of AAPL, RIMM, NOK, DELL & HPQ <br/>since the launch of the original iPhone in January 2007. As can be seen that <br/>launch took place in the latter stages of a 5 year recover for technology <br/>stocks that peaked in October 2007. At that time the combined market cap of <br/>these 5 stocks was $595 bln and was broadly distributed with AAPL at $165 bln, <br/>NOK $156 bln, HPQ $133 bln, RIMM $69 bln and DELL $69 bln.<br/><br/>Almost 5 years later the total market cap of this group has grown modestly to <br/>$690 bln but is now utterly dominated by AAPL at $615 bln. The remainder is <br/>made up by HPQ $39 bln, Dell $21 bln, NOK $10 bln and RIMM $3 bln. Thus the <br/>vast majority of AAPL's explosive run up can be said to have simply come at the <br/>expense of its closest rivals in phone and PC manufacturing.<br/><br/>We recognize that we are making a gross simplification in this study but our <br/>general point is that AAPL's stunning gains has been much more a story about <br/>ripping business opportunity from its rivals (and hence attracting investor <br/>flows) than the sort of bubbly enthusiasm that ended in disarray 12 years ago. <br/>We have not particular view at the attraction of AAPL at the current levels (we <br/>leave that to those better qualified in such matters), but we would not make <br/>the mistake of using the run up of its stock to declare the US equity market to <br/>be a hot-bed of speculation. - aaplndx.gif]]></content></article></index>
